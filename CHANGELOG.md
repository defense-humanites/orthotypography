# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Run the comma, period, and high-punctuation rules once on the logical run
  instead of once per fragment (#21). Calling their `apply` methods directly now
  throws. Outputs are unchanged, except next to empty protected nodes, which no
  longer affect these rules: `Bonjour,` · empty protected node · `monde` now
  receives the space after the comma. The space after a comma followed by a long
  unbroken token is now checked in linear time; 125,000 characters of `a,` took
  about 21 s and now take about 0.1 s.
- Keep the pipeline linear in the number of edits, protected ranges, and
  fragments: edits are assembled in one pass instead of rebuilding the value for
  each edit, protected ranges are found by binary search, and results no longer
  pass large arrays as call arguments, which exceeded the call stack beyond
  about 125,000 changes or fragments. Outputs are unchanged. The benchmark gains
  a `--scaling` option that measures growth on adversarial inputs.
- Run `FRENCH_GUILLEMETS_SPACING_RULE` once on the logical run instead of once
  per fragment (#21). Calling its `apply` method directly now throws; run it
  through `runPipeline` or `runTextNodePipeline`. Outputs are unchanged.
- Compute the pairing of French guillemets once per logical run instead of once
  per fragment. With the linear ledger, 500,000 characters take about 0.4 s in
  fix mode as one segment and 0.5 s as 3,977 nodes, instead of 33 s and 26 s in
  `0.1.0-alpha.3`. Outputs are unchanged.
- Apply each rule's edits to the change ledger in one pass, and locate
  diagnostics and rebuild source changes without rescanning the ledger. Fix mode
  no longer grows quadratically with the number of edits: 500,000 characters in
  one segment take about 7 s instead of 33 s with `IMPRIMERIE_NATIONALE_RULES`.
  Outputs are unchanged (#20).
- Fix currency classification so that a symbol already following an amount is no
  longer reattached to the next amount: `25 € 30 €` stays unchanged instead of
  becoming `25 30 € €` with the euro rule in `fix` mode (#30).
- Group decimal parts by threes only when classifying numbers, so that `12,5 12`
  is no longer read as one number (#30).
- Protect times with seconds (`23:45:10`) and drive-letter paths
  (`C:\Temp\rapport.txt`, `D:/data`) from colon spacing. The numeric classifier
  reports the new `path` construct kind (#32).
- Stop removing the space before a run of periods in
  `punctuation.period.no-space-before`. Suspension points follow their own
  spacing rules, and a space before them is correct when they stand for a word
  (`Il m’a traité de ... devant tout le monde.`); `Alors ...` is now left
  unchanged, like `Alors …`, and the composition with the ellipsis glyph rule is
  stable in one pass (#31).

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-09-26

- Insert missing spaces after commas in safe prose contexts, including across
  unprotected text segments, while preserving numeric and technical syntax
  (`SPACE_AFTER_COMMA_RULE`). The rule is part of `IMPRIMERIE_NATIONALE_RULES`
  and `IMPRIMERIE_NATIONALE_PUNCTUATION_RULES`, so both compositions can now
  produce additional changes.
- Remove suspension points after standalone `etc.` across unprotected text
  segments while preserving source UTF-16 coordinates (`ETC_ELLIPSIS_RULE`, part
  of `IMPRIMERIE_NATIONALE_RULES`).
- Execute and diagnose the spaces following colons, semicolons, question marks,
  and exclamation marks under their own rule IDs. `HIGH_PUNCTUATION_RULES` now
  contains eight atomic rules instead of four; fixed text is unchanged, but
  diagnostics, `appliedRuleIds`, and `TextChange.ruleIds` report the new
  `*.space-after` IDs.
- Recognize certain final and structurally initial ellipses written as `U+2026`
  or exactly three `U+002E`. `ELLIPSIS_GLYPH_RULE` diagnoses the ASCII form by
  default and converts it to `…` in explicit `fix` mode;
  `ELLIPSIS_RECOGNITION_RULE` is an alias of the same rule.
- Add `ELLIPSIS_INITIAL_SPACE_AFTER_RULE`, which diagnoses a missing space after
  a structurally initial `…` followed by a letter and inserts `U+0020` in
  explicit `fix` mode.
- Add `DIGIT_GROUPING_RULE` (`number.digits.grouping`), a diagnostic-only rule
  for ungrouped digits in classified measurements, percentages, and currency
  amounts. It never emits changes.
- The ellipsis and digit grouping rules default to `lint` and belong to no
  preset.
- Add atomic documentary catalogue entries for word spacing after periods,
  colons, semicolons, question marks, and exclamation marks, and for the
  ellipsis glyph and its spacing functions.
- Add a source-backed coverage matrix for the Imprimerie nationale preset and
  specifications for ellipses and digit grouping.
- Add explicit public API types required by current Deno 2 lint checks.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-09-09

- Add `applyTextChanges` for guarded application of source-coordinate changes to
  strings and segmented documents.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-05

- Add source-coordinate `TextChange` sets with optimistic `expected` guards.
- Compose rule provenance across successive edits without reconstructing a
  post-processing diff.
- Let runtime rules expose precise atomic edits while retaining a conservative
  whole-fragment fallback for existing rules.
- Apply one rule's edits as an atomic transaction across neighboring text
  segments.
- Normalize French high punctuation across inline formatting boundaries while
  preserving split technical and expressive sequences.
- Remove whitespace before commas and periods when it belongs to neighboring
  inline text segments.

## [0.1.0-alpha.0] - 2026-09-01

- Add the JavaScript package scaffold and coordinated JSR/npm distribution
  model.
- Add the machine-readable documentary catalogue and candidate French presets.
- Add the generic ordered pipeline with protected segment support.
- Add a pure classifier for protected and transformable numeric constructs.
- Add safe executable rules for whitespace before commas and periods.
- Convert classified ranges into stable protected segments in the pipeline.
- Add source-specific French spacing rules for colons, semicolons, question
  marks, and exclamation marks.
- Add classified no-break spacing before percentage and per-mille symbols.
- Add paired French-guillemet spacing across protected numeric segments.
- Add a versioned, case-sensitive BIPM registry for SI units and prefixes.
- Add registry-backed unit-spacing diagnostics with explicit opt-in fixes.
- Add an ambiguity-aware monetary registry and opt-in euro-symbol fixes.
- Add a validated, provenance-preserving importer for SIX ISO 4217 List One.
- Resolve conservative SI products, quotients, and Unicode powers.
- Parse parenthesized SI expressions into a public, read-only AST.
