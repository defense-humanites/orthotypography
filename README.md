# orthotypography

Source-backed orthotypographic primitives and named editorial presets for the
JavaScript ecosystem, including browsers and server runtimes.

The `0.1.0-alpha.3` release is a public preview. Its API and rule catalogue may
change during the alpha series. The canonical TypeScript package is distributed
through JSR; an equivalent ESM package is generated from the same sources for
npm.

## Installation

```sh
deno add jsr:@orthotypography/core@0.1.0-alpha.3
npm install @orthotypography/core
```

## Current status

The repository contains a documentary catalogue, a machine-readable rule model,
two candidate French presets, the generic pipeline infrastructure, a
numeric-context classifier, and executable punctuation rules. The
source-specific high-punctuation composition protects technical and numeric
contexts before transforming text. The Imprimerie nationale composition also
inserts a missing word space after a comma when prose follows and removes
suspension points after `etc.`. Opt-in rules outside the presets diagnose or, in
explicit `fix` mode, correct certain ellipses, and diagnose ungrouped digits in
classified quantities. Every rule runs once per pass on one logical run across
text nodes, so that constructs split by inline formatting are handled, while
text-node integrations preserve the formatting boundaries.

```ts
import {
  applyTextChanges,
  IMPRIMERIE_NATIONALE_RULES,
  runPipeline,
} from "@orthotypography/core";
import { PRESETS, RULES } from "@orthotypography/core/catalogue";

const result = runPipeline(
  "Bonjour , monde : 25%.",
  IMPRIMERIE_NATIONALE_RULES,
  { locale: "fr-FR" },
);

console.log(result.value);
// "Bonjour, monde\u00a0: 25\u00a0%."

// In fix mode, source-coordinate changes can be applied individually by
// editors while preserving stable rule provenance.
console.log(result.changes);
console.log(applyTextChanges("Bonjour , monde : 25%.", result.changes));
```

## Writing a rule

A rule is called once per pass with a read-only view of the whole logical run:
the concatenated text of every input segment, its protected ranges, node
boundaries, and annotations from classify rules. It returns edits and
diagnostics in run coordinates; the pipeline validates them and projects them
onto the input segments. Rules of other packages use IDs prefixed with `x-`.

```ts
import { runPipeline, type RuntimeRule } from "@orthotypography/core";

const noDoubleSpace: RuntimeRule = {
  id: "x-example.no-double-space",
  phase: "cleanup",
  locales: ["fr-FR"],
  defaultMode: "lint",
  apply(run) {
    const edits = [...run.text.matchAll(/ {2,}/g)]
      .map((match) => ({
        start: match.index,
        end: match.index + match[0].length,
        replacement: " ",
      }))
      .filter(({ start, end }) =>
        !run.protectedRanges.some((range) =>
          range.start < end && start < range.end
        )
      );
    return {
      diagnostics: edits.map((edit) => ({ ...edit, message: "Double space" })),
      ...(run.mode === "fix" ? { edits } : {}),
    };
  },
};

runPipeline("Bonjour  monde", [noDoubleSpace], { locale: "fr-FR", mode: "fix" })
  .value; // "Bonjour monde"
```

boundaries and

the first French source review. The
[`Imprimerie nationale coverage matrix`](./docs/matrice-couverture-in-2002-v0.1.md)
tracks each documented prescription through catalogue, runtime, tests, and
preset activation.
